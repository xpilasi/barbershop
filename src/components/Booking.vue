const description = "A traditionally-inspired upscale barbershop on the ground floor of the Walper Hotel. Paying homage to Abel Walper, the hotel's founder, by honouring his commitment to a finely tailored, personalized customer experience that's unmatched in both quality and character. Originally established in 1894 just one year after the hotel's opening, the new shop reimagines Abel's vision in a contemporary barber setting."
